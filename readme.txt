Stretch questions:
Why are ID selectors a bad idea? 
    Because each object should have a unique ID and are harder to find in code than other selectors.
    Even though classes have the same visibility, multiple items can have that class. This makes 
    classes a better pick than IDs in most cases.
What selectors should you prefer when working with CSS?
    Element selectors and Class selectors. Elements are better since elements are easier for us
    to find and read. Classes are better for the reason in question 1.
